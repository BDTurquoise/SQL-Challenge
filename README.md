# SQL-Challenge
Module 9 Challenge files

Hello! Please find my files for Challenge 9 in this repository. The ERD png image for Pewlett Hackard is located in the main directory. The detailed SQL code can be found in the EmployeeSQL directory.

The SQL file is organized with the Data Engineering (table schemata) at the top. The subsequent Data Analysis responses are numbered below.

I have also included a separate SQL file for the Table Schemata as required by the challenge directions.

Thank you.
